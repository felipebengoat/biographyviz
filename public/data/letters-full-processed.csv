Tengo el honor de comunicarle que el sábado 3 del mes en curso su hijo Luis recibió el título de arquitecto.

Como proyecto para optar a dicho grado presentó una construcción de puerto pesquero que le valió de su Profesor, el reputado arquitecto Behrens, el premio que anualmente otorga al mejor trabajo realizado por sus discípulos.

En la solemne ceremonia que se celebró, con este motivo, en la Academia de Bellas Artes, nos dimos el placer de asistir con mi Señora. Para nosotros fué un gusto y una emoción representar a Ud. en los momentos en que se veían coronados los esfuerzos de tres años de serios y provechosos estudios.

Al felicitar a Ud. y Señora por este éxito, cúmpleme expresarle que Luis ya salió de Viena y que se embarca en Bremen el 12 del corriente en viaje a Chile, donde lo esperan el afecto de los suyos, que ven cumplidas con creces las esperanzas que tenían cuando lo enviaron a Europa.

Lo saluda muy atentamente

Was glad to get your letter and know that you are planning to come back to the Behrens school next fall and also that you are staying in Europe over the summer. Your plans sound very interesting; perhaps we might be able to do some of the things together.

My plans for Dalmatia have been fading considerably in the past few weeks because the outlook is that I would have to go alone which does not appeal to me. In the meantime, however, Erick and Franz Krandt have been thinking something about a trip to Spain from here or a hike through the north of Italy and south of France. The idea is very appealing aside from being inexpensive but I am still not sure of the

plans will materialize.

The Swiss Aufsitz Camp in Zurich, or whatever it is, sounds like a good idea as it is always to save some money for trips later in the season. Also I know a number of people who will be there who would be a great help as far as announcements were concerned. I would appreciate you giving me more details & in regard to what sort of a thing this camp is, its name, etc.

I really want to do quite some travelling during the summer but have to take care that it doesn’t cost too much as my allowance seems to be shrinking. At any rate let me hear more about your plans because we might be able to work out something together.

Things are running along fast now here in Vienna. The Academy closes on the 19 of June and then is plenty for me to do between now and then on my project. Aside from that an

exhibition of paintings (of my father) is opening next week and the publicity and other things connected with it have kept me on the run.

May 22

I have now gotten around to finishing this letter. It is rather afraid about having opened this morning. People seem to be rather enthusiastic about it so I am hoping that it will be a success.

An architect I met here from England studying sports facilities (baths, pools for swimming, etc.) is very anxious to buy a Contax Camera. He may be passing through Vienna so I advised him to look you up; first, because it’s quite interesting both to someone ahead, and secondly, because I believe you said that you had some sort of connection with Zeiss Contax, with the possibility of getting a reduction in its retail price. But any rate don’t be surprised when he drops in on you if he does come through Vienna.

The negatives of yours were cut apart by Erick and Franz to make copying them easier. Hope that it makes no difference to you.

Regards to you, Luis, and if possible let me hear from you as soon as possible regarding Zurich.

letter-S128,S128,Carta a Luis Mitrovic Balbontín,1938-10-13 00:00:00,Winold Tjark Reiss,Luis Mitrovic Balbontín,,"Dear Lucho!

You Rat, you snake in the grass, where in hell do you get the nerve to write and say you don't know whose fault it is that our correspondence has lapsed so — you know very well that I didn't answer your last letter — it's just your Chilean politeness that makes you try to beat around the bush. But to be perfectly truthful I have meant to write to you for the past four months and never just gotten around to it. Well, your letter now has given me such a conscience that within five minutes after receiving it I am answering.

All your news was very interesting. I knew that you were on the ski team as a friend of Burgos and Paredes, Edgar Plath, who came up with them showed me a Chilean paper with your picture in the ski group. Since leaving Chile I have often thought of the fine skiing I had there and hope that someday I will be able to return to repeat my experiences. To say the least I am very envious of you. I have various plans for going out west to Sun Valley in Idaho for a couple of weeks this winter but do not know if they will really materialize. While visiting a friend of mine up in Massachusetts this summer I met W. Hilte, the Swiss chap who used to teach in Chile — I believe you knew him.

For three and a half months I have been living alone. My Mother has left for Europe for a year’s stay — mostly in Paris. When I knew that she was going I had to look around for a small apartment for myself and found a very nice place considering everything & price mostly. I have two small rooms, kitchen, and bath which look quite nice now that I have fixed them up considerably. I live in a semi basement apartment in an old house separated from the house on the street by a little garden which gives me plenty of quiet. Almost like living in the county. A fireplace makes it even more attractive. I usually eat at home and find it very easy to broil steak, etc., over charcoal in the fireplace for such friends who I feel like inviting. An extra bed gives me the atmosphere of running an hotel whenever out of town friends happen to be staying over in the city. So, now you know that there is a place for you to stay when you make that projected trip to New York. You are welcome for a day, a week, a month or a year — if you stay a year you can save enough money to take a Packard back to Chile with you.

What is all this I have read in the papers about a baby revolution in Santiago? I had to go to Peru for an earthquake and come back to the States to hear about a revolution. Really you didn't have things planned very well for me.

Talking of political situations, it has certainly been interesting to follow events in europe. All our old friends who would have loved to say to us ""I told you so"". I wonder how they are all getting along these days. I am sure that some of them have met with some disappointments. For me the most encouraging thing of all was to hear that there would be no war. A war would have no doubt meant the end of the present system of civilization in europe. Here in New York the refugees keep pouring in faster than ever, I only fear that a race prejudice drive may start here in the not too distant future. From Better and Schaller I have already received pleas to send Afidavits to make it possible for them to come over to this country. Not being assured of steady

employment I can do nothing for them. There is one person who I often wonder about — Franz von Hildebrand. I hope that he was able to get out before they got him as he was on their black list.

From Nora I hear quite often. She wrote that you had written to her some time ago and was very glad to think that you still thought of the family. Lately I have had a rather depressing letter from her. All their friends seem to have left Vienna with the result that she and her sister are rather left to themselves. No doubt the recent war scare had a lot to do with her state of mind.

Here in New York conditions seem to be improving a little although there is still comparatively little building going on/ My Father has been kept pretty busy with the result that I have enough to do. He recently completed a new Restaurant in the Empire State Building which is really very striking. I am sure that you would like it very much. The World’s Fair is progressing fast. Many of the buildings are up already. Practically all the buildings have huge murals on the outside. I don't believe that there has ever been a fair where the art work has been so ""en masse"". Dad is doing the murals on the outside of the Theatre and Concert Building. He is using two metals (aluminum and brass) and mosaic. One of the figures is 12 meters high and a mask representing acting is of about the same height. He has also made the color scheme for the outside of the building and for the lobbies and theatre auditorium.

I still have my state examination to look forward to. It is still not determined if I will be able to take it this spring. When it is over I will feel new born.

One of the photos I took down on my visit to Lucho Valdez was accepted for publication in ""U. S. Camera 1939"". It was one taken at the Rodeo San Fernandez of milling steers. The only reason I can feel proud of the fact of their accepting it is that they chose only two hundred pictures from over ten thousand which were submitted from all parts of the United States. During the summer I don't think I took over one roll of film which has at least saved me some money.

Please say ""hello"" to everybody for me — especially to your Mother and Father who were so kind to me. I hope to still print the photos I promised L. Valdez and Tito. I will print the Berlenga pictures soon and send them to you by regular mail.

Let me hear from you again and not next year!","Dear Lucho!

All I can say is that it is the only earthquake that I could read about intelligently, as I had been to most of the places affected and on top of the volcanoes in recent wild eruption. It must have been a terrible thing — particularly for those who lived through the first shocks to be scared out of their wits by the later ones.

Your work sounds very remarkable and I am full of envy. I can easily picture you working your way in your office and telling how the way it was done ahead. The commissions you have had so far sound particularly interesting and just the type of things you like so much. I hope you do send me photos of some of the work...

While I am still on the subject of Chile I must warn you to expect some friends of mine — Mr. & Mrs. BRUCE GIMBEL, who are flying around South America in their own plane. They may already have reached Chile with this letter. I gave them your name, but I hope not. They had planned staying only a couple of days in Chile; but after my talk to them I think they will stay longer. As a matter of fact I talked so enthusiastically that I believe that in the end they must have thought me an agent of the Chilean Government. They seem to be quite nice people and I think you will enjoy meeting them.

I still haven’t developed, or rather printed all my photos of the

trip. I sold some to the National Geographic a few weeks ago. Otherwise I have not had particular luck with them — to me, however, they still bring back memories of the wonderful time I had in S.A. and particularly in Chile, due to your help.

Here in New York the World’s Fair is progressing. I don’t see how they can possibly have everything ready on time but maybe they will. My father has made the exterior mural and interior decoration for the theatre out there. Other than that there has not been much to do for it. It will be an interesting affair. Built on the “democratic” idea of free expression there are a few good things and some perfectly terrible ones. Quite a contrast to similar developments in Germany or Italy where one standard exists throughout. The proportions of the thing are staggering and it should be a very interesting thing to visit. They are planning on a two year run and I have heard rumours of even three years. The “theme” of the whole thing is rather a joke. Everybody feels it looks like Göring’s or failed reproductive organ and I must say I rather agree. It is certainly no architectural motive in my mind. More like a phallic symbol of older times. I believe it is be rather absurd that they did not exercise more control over the planning of the whole thing. When do you plan coming up to see it? If you have any friends who want to come warn them not to come during July or August as the heat out here it is is simply

terrible during those two months.

Right now the U.S. is being thoroughly scared by the President and the newspapers regarding the dictators of Europe and the possibility of war. They could mind their own business over here and will have us as a war yet. I only hope that Roosevelt gets human and during the next election before he has us revengeing the Jews. The only reason anybody with the least bit of brains can see in his attacks on foreign dictators is to try to hide the misgivings of the present administration which so far has not been able to return to U.S. prosperity. With a lot of war industry they think they can put people to work. The people here are actually beginning to believe that Hitler wants to send bombers over here to attack and enter the U.S. The Germans are getting absolutely superhuman. And as far as South America is concerned the belief is prevalent that the Nazis are fast on the road to controlling business and trade and will soon be making colonies and you Chileans, Bolivians, Peruvians, etc. When the Socialists lose and in Chile it will be just another proof of fascist conquests.

Well Lucho, you dog you, say “hello” to everybody for me with particular greetings to your mother and father.

Wish you all the success with your work.

Muchas gracias for the splendid fotos; your new IKONTA is certainly a wonder. I liked the ones of Chiquita and Lollita immensely; will see that they reach their rightful destination as soon as the senoritas in question blow into town. Right now, Patty is whirling around Cape Cod with some German Count Von Opal — ""Might as well look into the Axis now that we've covered the Allies"" she writes — and Frankie is leading all the farmer's sons to ruin in the rural countryside of Woodstock, Vermont. They expect to be on hand and all waxed for the ski season in New York and points north, however.

As for me, Uncle Sam finally caught up with me, and after a hectic two weeks out at Sun Valley skiing in a Military Ski Troop Training Film, I went down south to Virginia, where I have been sweating my life's blood and the season's crop of martinis away. I am making a training film on the care and feeding of pontoon bridges, than which there is nothing duller, but — there is hope of a commission as a second Lieutenant soon, so all is not lost.

As for the film, I have been working on that most of the summer, and it is in pretty tip top shape by now. Deborah Bankart of the Hanover Ski School is going to lecture with it for me, and we have got bookings all over the country. The Rockefeller Committee has purchased rights to the highlights of it — about a forty minute reel in Spanish soundtrack — so you should be able to see that at the American embassy in Santiago in about three months.

Glad to hear the good news about Julio; give him our best from up here; the impression of pluck and courage he made will not soon be forgotten. And let me know how Jaime made out in the nationals; I will try and sell the three pix you sent, but can't guarantee it.

Sounds like a good skiing year in Chile — you must be spring skiing now on Villarica and Osorno; bet it can't beat the chair lifts in the Sugar Bowl, tho! How did Agustin's portable ski tow work out? And is Arturo setting up a ski school for tired maidens on the side, as in Yosemite? Tell me all the news, so I can relay it to Roland and Duby and Los Camp Followers...

letter-S37,S37,Carta a Luis Mitrovic Balbontín,1943-05-28 00:00:00,Nora,Luis Mitrovic Balbontín,,"My dear Lucho,

I have just received your letter from April 5th and was so pleased to get it because I feared I was never going to hear from you again. I did not congratulate you upon your engagement and this is why: When I saw Cucho last Xmas, he told me a lot about you and chiefly about things in connection with me (that I could NEVER have guessed from your letters). Maybe he shouldn’t have told me, so don’t be angry with him. But then he told me of your engagement. I was really rather disappointed and preferred to wait until I could write you a nice letter. I nearly got married myself after that, but changed my mind just in time to save myself from committing an awful mistake. And talking about “mistake” — I want to come to the chief point of this letter. When you say “that, not having had a letter from me for such ages — caused you, you realized lately, to make several mistakes, that had us way out” — do you mean to say, that you are not quite happy about your engagement? I cannot think of anything else and so forgive me if I am wrong. But, Lucho, PLEASE don’t ever get married if you are not sure of making a success of marriage. I’ve seen that unhappy marriage can be like, beginning with my own mother. It isn’t worth the misery you have to go through. But of course I am talking without

knowing why there is no “way out” as my sermon is perhaps out of place. — I still wish you the very best of luck and I mean that.

As I think it is very bad to write depressed letter, I am very sorry that I wrote you one. It must have been my asthma, of which, by the way, I have got rid of completely. No more cats — no asthma!

I had such a lovely holiday — the first one for 2 years — I shall never forget it. Perfect spring weather, good books, good music and two satchels (dug) in a big house of a friend of mine. It was perfect. Now I am working again. This time harder than I have ever worked before. Every day I wish that I were stronger than I am, because with such hard work I get so very very tired. But I have to do it and that’s that!

Shortly after my last letter to you, Mary wrote to me, to tell me that she was going to have a baby in July. I am so glad and I am to be the godmother. Only I shan’t be able to hold my nephew or niece in my arms until the war is over. I am glad you like children Lucho, they are such fun. What a pity that all your friends seem to be able to come over here so easily and that you are so far away yourself. I would so like to see you again. I should think that we must both have changed, because it is so many years since we last saw each other.

I will write to you again very soon, in case this letter gets lost on its way. I hope it won’t. Do write to me very soon and PLEASE don’t be afraid to tell about yourself. You never seem to do so. And tell me about your house and your plans for the future. Don’t be shy please!

Lots and lots of love
Yours
Nora

It’s just now that I have received your letter from May 28th. It’s so nice of you to take so much pain about me.

My marriage is not going to be a failure, without being perfect. I will tell you how it happened and with out knowing about it:

I have always been in love with you, but as Tjark was between us, I kept it to myself, but I always thought of you as the right person to help one make a success of life as you had amongst other qualities, the feeling for art, lecture, painting, music etc. In general you had understood at the way I agreed.

A while after I wrote you summer started (November — March 1942) and I used to see Angela, my fiancée at a Country Club near Santiago where I went swimming. As I was a friend of her older sister, and

I didn’t like her, I thought she was alike, and I didn’t take any notice of her before. As I started going out with her we saw each other often in the Club, some we came together, went out together sometimes, went back and forth to the Club together — as time went by I noticed that she was falling in love. As I had no news from you since so long, and felt rather disappointed about it, I started going out with her frequently until I noticed she had fallen in love with me, then I stopped seeing her for quite a while until I realised

that I had grown a liking for her first and then we both fell in love.

Angela is awfully sweet, attractive, at least to one, but we have nothing in common except skiing and camping. She has a rather common way of looking at art, with no idea of literature, were I am weak myself. At the beginning she didn’t care, later she has been trying her best to understand it, but without getting exactly to the point but without improving my own more less finding a new point of view. The thing is I don’t see any chance of her helping me with my work

and it will have to be a life, and this is a thing between a life in the only work and life at home.

She is awfully religious and this is a thing I would never have thought my wife to be. She already has save it up to convert me into active Catholic. Anyway I prefer my children to be brought up have a religious upbringing once they are grown up they can choose as they want. The thing is, I tell you that there was no way out — well, we are very much in love, just the same, and I hope

this is going to make us both change a little for the best, as we already have. The thing is, and this made me tell you “that there was no way out,” that if I had heard of you before, I would have never fallen in love with her ....

You are the only person to know all my feelings about my marriage!

I am so sorry to tell you all this, as if life wasn’t enough complicated for you over there.

I am so glad you had a pleasant holiday after all, you must have had a

hell of a time with your asthma etc...

It’s fine Mary is going to have a baby, and so glad for both of them. I don’t know if it is setting old, but I do want to have a boy and so does Angela fortunately.

I have heard that Sergio Larraín is in England since a week. It must be awfully interesting for him.

Well, do write as often as you can with all my love

A few days ago I received your letter of June 16th. I don’t think I can tell you how happy it has made me. I like that you say about Angela and I am sorry I cannot meet her. I understand everything you say in your letter, and these last 4 weeks I did quite a lot of thinking and came to the conclusion that it would be far more valuable for you and me to remain just friends. You mustn’t think that if you talk about your own life or worries and troubles, you bother me in any way. It may seem strange, but if one has trouble, of one’s own (including the war of course) it is almost a recreation to think about other people’s problems, because it does take one’s mind off one’s own difficulties. So if it does you any good at all, to tell me your problems or even to grumble, please do so. I am even more optimistic about your marriage than you are.

I feel that Angela (what a lovely name) is very young. And I am convinced that she loves you very much. And that will make her want to be interested in the things that you are interested in. By the way, Lucho, I can tell you from my own experience, that even at my age (nearly 28)

I am still learning about art and music and literature. In the past year, especially in music, I have learned to appreciate and love some things, that I either didn’t know years ago, or wouldn’t have cared for, or even understood. And I have learned all this all on my own, because I don’t know a soul here, who really cares for good music. Cincho does. Well you see Lucho, there is no reason why you should fear that Angela may never acquire a taste for music and art. The more she will see and hear the better she will like it. I wonder why I never spoke about the religion with you. Perhaps it was because Tjark didn’t care for it and during that year in which you knew me I went through the most unreligious period of my life, so far. But since the age of 14 up to now, religion meant everything to me and without it, I should be a complete ass. It is a religion of my own though and for years I haven’t felt the urge to go to church, or discuss religion with other people. I am glad that Angela is religious, I believe that people who have a sound (strong) religion are not so easily knocked off their pedestal. I am so perfectly certain that you too will be happy. I should very much like to have a photo of you and Angela. — Mary had a little boy 2 weeks ago and is very happy.

I haven’t heard from Tjark for ages and I hope that he’s alright. My life is not really dull now, I have made new friends and I have changed my job. But I will tell you about my new job when I have started it, which will be next week.

Your friend Sergio is enjoying the gay life in London and maybe that I will see Lucho soon before he goes back to Chile. They will both have lots to tell you about life in general over here.

By the time you get this, you maybe married. Anyway I wish you all the best of luck and Angela too. Don’t forget to write and tell me about the wedding and send me a photograph — that is, when all the excitement is over and you find time.

A big kiss for Lucho

Yours

I thank Prof. Dietz and Mrs Daves, the hostess for providing me with the opportunity of presenting my Slide Show on Afghanistan, and less in depth on Iran and Lebanon.

In 1972-73 I visited twice, mostly the North of that beautiful country and its lovely people. The purpose of those visits were while working in THE WORLD BANK as part of a team working on an appraisal of the potential in tourism in Afghanistan, that could help that country very much with more hard currency and local work opportunities. At that time HRH Mohammed Zahir Shah was King. I became a very good friend of his brother, Prince Wali Khan Shah when he discovered that we had studied architecture at the same school in Vienna, Austria. Later the greed for power of the King's cousin deposed him, and successive political intrigue for power degenerated into the invasion of Afghanistan by Russia, and brought undeserved suffering and struggle for freedom for those people that have that admirable combination of being proud, brave and extremely kind ..... With a per capita income as low as $65 they were very happy, because by tradition they had learned to be selfsufficient on that low income. The Consumer Economy through its persistent propaganda to encourage to buy goods would have made the people very unhappy, as with such low income they would never be able to purchase those goods. But fate had for them something much worse, that was communism and war.

HISTORY and GEOGRAPHY

Great part of Afghanistan is part of the HINDUKUSH MOUNTAIN RANGE--a continuation of the Himalayas--1920 mi. long and an average hight of its peaks of 5000m or 16000 f.

The PREHISTORIC MAN according to the research of

french archeologists is supposed to have lived in North Afghanistan 50,000 years ago.

The cities of DEHMORASI + MUNDIGA, North of Afghanistan on the river OXUS - that today borders Russia — just as MOHENJODARO and HARRAPA on the river Indus, had blooming trade from 2500 to 1350 BC, the very early result of their need of supply of the village farmers while the Cities provided them with economic supply. One of the main products of trade was Lapis. DEHMORASI desapeared 1500 BC because of a shift of the Oxus river, MUNDIGA 500 years later because of wars and invasions.

ZOROASTER or ZARATHUSTRA was the Great Leader who united the ARIANS, that had emigrated from the East and settled in Afghanistan 1000 to 600 BC. He encouraged Agriculture and so the land BACTRIA prospered. Successive migrations of ARIANS from the East Trans Oxiana, finding Afghanistan occupied by the Vedic Arians, moved into the IRAN Plateau, and eventually strecthed from the border of Greece to the Indus River. Many ORCHAEMENIC Kings ruled, but the Zoroastran remained their Religion.

When DARIUS I, 522 to 486 BC, conquered Afghanistan - this is interesting because it was him that built Persepolis, that we will see in my slides when we get to actual Iran - then this King built roads that crossed Afghanistan, that served for migrations of countless tribes West and invasions, and most important for the SILK RTE. and other trades from China to Rome.

HINDUKUSH

This valley ...and the 5 BAND I AMIR Lakes 10000 feet high was where the SILK ROUTE crossed Afghanistan from the West into BAMlYAN 148 miles over the SHIBAR PASS to KABUL, the capital, and then through the KHYBER PASS to Pakistan, and so on to China.

The BUDDHAS were built 400 or 500 AD, when the TRADE flourished between the Caesars in Rome and the HAN Dinasties in China. The small BUDDHA 125 feet was the first to be built, may be 300 AD by the Moguls. It was sculptured on the rock, then coatmoldered with straw and mud, and then stucco that was painted bright blue, the face arms, and hands were gold leaf with semi precious stones.

The 2d. Buddha, 172 feet high had wood studs introduced to the rock, thik ropes attached, moldered to it the coat with stucco painted bright red, the rest same as the other. Then came the dark ages of the Ghaznavids, that under the banner of Islam, destroid all the faces of the Buddhas.

THE RED CITY, 1100 to 1200 AD, 17 km. 11 mi. Bamiyan between the rivers Bamiyan and Kulu it protected the entrance to the valley of Bamiyan, and its very properous rich city that carried its name, with King palace, sumptous villas and lush gardens. While in peace 500 soldiers, under war 2 to 3000. First Stage, square towers with wood planks and loopholes for the soldiers to shot arrows. Second Stage, Halls, eating and sleeping quarters. Third top Stage, warehouses and stables etc...

In 1221 AD the Mongols under the leadership of GENGHIS KAHN, he sent his favorite Grandson to take over the Red city Fortress. Because of its inexpugnability he could not enter it, but got mortally killed. In revenge Ghenghis Khan got together an army of 200,000. A traitor told him of the hidden supply of water to the fortress, and the garrison eventually was forced to surrender. Consecuently Genghis stormed and devasteted to the ground the City of Bamiyam, you can still see the ruins of the King's palace.

MAZAR I SHARIF, 40,000 inhab., 266 mi. from Kabul on the paved road built by the Russians to its boarder crossing the tunneled the SALANG PASS, 11,100 feet high.

THE SHRINE OF HAZRAT ALI 1481 AD

NO GUMBAD Mosque in Balkh, the earliest Islam architecture, dates from the 10th cent. Highly decorated stucco.

KABUL, 500,000 inhab., 5,900 feet high. Originally a Greek settlement by Alexander the Great of Macedonia 330 B.C. Story......

BALA HISSAR FORTRESS. The British found a pretext 1838 to take control over Afghanistan, but had such a rough time with the Afghans, that the had King Nadir Shah to take over in 1901

I hope you are still alive to be able to read my letter of thanks for your Christmas letter of December 1997. I did mean to write to you last year (1998) but didn’t because last year was a very hard and very sad year for me. Étienne had started with small attacks of senile dementia some 3 years ago and this sad state became very violent at the beginning of 98. It was very sad to see my Étienne in this state and it was very difficult and strenuous to look after him. He was absolutely unrecognizable and I had to take leave of him bit by bit, week by week, month by month. There is no medicine or therapy to stop this degenerative illness. I am 83 years old and our doctor didn’t think I would be able to manage. Étienne refused any help from strangers and as he was up and about, he fell frequently but couldn’t get up by himself and I couldn’t go on getting the Red Cross Ambulance to help me. So in August last year I managed to get him to a very good nursing home. He was not happy there because everything was strange to him. However he was not happy at home because even in our flat in familiar surroundings he was completely forlorn. He usually recog

nized me but not always. He was well looked after in the house and when he wandered and fell there were male nurses to pick him up. But he hurt himself frequently, his wounds were well treated but he would, in his complete ignorance, tear off bandages. I visited him every day. In September one wound after a fall got septic. He was taken to hospital and I went with him. I knew when I saw him that this septicaemia was his end. I visited him 4 days at the hospital but he no longer moved, his lovely blue eyes were open — without seeing — and I spoke to him and tried to hold his hand, but there was no reaction and I knew he was going. I wanted him to die while I was with him. I was informed that he expired 20 minutes after I had left the hospital. Étienne was 92 years old. I can’t tell you how sorry I was for him in this dreadful state. His daughter and son came for the funeral and Étienne was cremated. Now I am alone in our flat but I will have to look for a place in a home for old people. I don’t mind being alone, I never feel alone by myself and as I am still good at walking and love nature I go for walks in the immediate surroundings. In the past years I have learned a lot about nature: plants, trees, insects and

animals but my favorite occupation has been for years — birdwatching. Last year I had little time for myself, which I didn’t even notice I was so engaged looking after Étienne. And since his death there is an awful lot to do after a death, which is just as well, as one has less time for sorrowing.

I well remember your letters and was, some years ago, much impressed by Angela’s intention to get you a dog after her death. I hope he or she as the case may be, still keeps you good company and that you are still able to take the dog for walks. Of course, nothing can replace your companion Angela. Étienne and I were married for 48 years and I like to think of my Étienne in his good years. Thinking of last year makes me cry because I was so terribly sorry for him in this awful mental state.

Well, Lucho, I hope you are in acceptably good health and I wish you all the best for the coming years.

Chapter I

The descendants of Esau were powerful people governed by Dukes.

It is not known when the first arrival of the Nabataeans was at Petra (possibly 600 or 500 BC) but the first history of them was 312 BC as the forces of Antigonus I. unsuccessfully attacked the City. Petra's period of greatest prosperity under the Nabaeans started 100 BC and ended with the conquest by the Romans in 106 AD. The Romans kept the trade that had made Petra great for a long time, but it was already declining because of changes in trade routes.

Petra deteriorated with the coming to power of the Islam around 700 AD and remained dormant only partially lifting during the twelfth century by the advent of the Crusaders who built a powerful fort. In 1265 AD it was admired by the Mameluk Sultan Beybars who visited Petra after having defeated Palmyra. After this Petra is forgotten completely and only remains as a myth. Only students were interested in visiting but couldn't as it was kept jealously guarded by war-like guards because of the myth that the Romans had left their treasures there. In 1812, 600 years since Petra had vanished in history, Burckhardt, an explorer, visited Petra for a few hours. He had learned Arabic during 3 years and lived amongst Arabs disguised as Sheikh Ibrahim. He risked his life when he did so. After that a few archaeologists and scientists and still more limited casual visitors, visited the ancient city. In 1830 a french traveller Léon de Laborde discovered Petra again; Dr. Musil was the first to make a scientific study of the tombs; the latest are Mr. Philby, a British advisor to the Trans-Jordan Government, and Sir Alexander Kennedy whose books attracted great interest.

As you near the entrance to the Siq, the narrow called entrance to the Wadi that is called the Basin, the route becomes often precipitous and sometimes slippery to the horses. The scenery becomes wilder and more wild like an entrance to a robbers cave. Great masses of stone towers above almost meeting over your head; after the Bab-Es-Siq (the gate of the Siq) the gorge narrows and the cliffs get more and more precipitous. We are riding over what was once a paved Roman road. Now, broken and overgrown by weeds. It serves as a brook in winter and is dried the beginning of springtime. The rose colored cliffs, 400 to 700 feet high, form a gorge 2 to 3 meters wide and is the only access to Petra on this side. It becomes dangerous during sudden floods. Many people could not get away in time and payed with their lives. Tamarisks, wild fig, caper plant, and oleander grow luxuriously in the road and crevices where the light reaches to the bottom of the gorge. As you continue riding the rocks are deep red, violet, almost sable. Then at a turn in the ravine you suddenly see the unforgettable picture of the El Khazneh Fur'un - the treasure house of Pharaoh framed in the dark gorge of the Siq. The color of the monument is more flame than rose sand stone designed under Nabataean architects under the influence of late Roman work, but carved direct into solid rock.

Passing on to take a general view of Petra you come into a street of tombs that widens out until you get to a theatre excavated out of the rock, from which you have an extraordinary view of the basin of the Wadi Musa, where successive towns have stood out are now only a mass of masonry covered by scrob and a tangle of oleander. On all sides the gaunt red cliffs stand honey combed by rock dwellings and tombs in which still live about 96 families. Here and there you see a pseudo classic façade or one that reminds you of Assyria or Egypt. It sounds paradoxical but is strictly true.

Petra - Jordan
Page two.

The principal features that impress the newcomer are: the chief street of the Roman town ran, as usual, along the bank of the river, which according to custom vaulted over for a considerable space. The remains of the Temple and part of the triple gate are the only built monuments still standing. They belong to a late period after the Roman annexation.

The huge mass called El-Habis by the Arabs is a bold promontory of rock which was one of the High Places of Sacrifice on one of its plateaux; the equally imposing Zebb' Atuf has the most finished of these ancient sacrificial places on its summit. Both of these commanding heights have remains of a fort which once guarded Petra and provided an observation for those who defended the almost impregnable city.

The two principal rock walls containing tombs of interest are the North-east walls where some of the finest of the classical tombs are situated - the Urn tomb, the Corinthian tomb and the tomb of the Governer to name the most famous; and the Southeast wall where some of the older and more interesting Nabataean tombs are found. The High Places are approached by climbing up ravines in which, from time to time, steps have been cut in the rock for the use of worshippers - another climb of this description leads up to the Deir, the so called Convent, from which magnificent views can be obtained.

To ascend the Zebb' Atuf, or Okelisk Mount, you have to follow a gorge to the left as you leave the Siq, mounting up a rock-hewn path with stairs cut at intervals up which the Nabataean climbed to worship Dusares. On the summit are two obelisks and places of sacrifice; higher up is the fort and higher again, the great Place of Sacrifice.

On the other side, that is the North side of the shelf, past the ruined tower of the fort and at the highest level and narrowest part of the ridge, lies the ""holy place"" of Zebb'Atuf, the largest and most complete and best preserved of all the Sacella of Petra. The sacrificial basin stands beside the alter, on the one side of a great cleared and levelled rectangle about fifty by twenty-two feet. On account of the narrowness of the ridge and its steep sides there is plenty of room for celebrants but absolutely none for worshippers. So it is presumed that only the priests performed their rituals on this eminence and that the worshippers followed them from a lower level.

The supreme god of the Natabaeans was Dusares or Dhu-Shara, the god of the fresh springs and the mountain district of Spara, the biblical Se'ir. The Nabataeans are also said to have worshipped the Sun. Dusares was later identified with Dionysius. The alters, lavers and other sacrificial objects are purely Semitic and might have been used by Esau, though they probably were hewn at a much later date. The sacrifices of the Nabataeans are said to have been an act of communion with the god, not an offering to appease him.

Chapter II

THE NABATAEAN CITY

The Khazne Fur'Un – The Treasure House of the Pharaon

Although the older Nabataean structures are undeniably the most curious and interesting of all the tombs of Petra, the so-called Treasure of the Pharaon is certainly the most beautiful. It is particularly most impressive to see when you suddenly leave the Siq and then see the soft flame color sandstone which form the greater part of the façade contrast with the cream colour of green bushes that makes a foreground even more beautiful when the oleanders are blooming pink in the springtime.

It is believed by many that this graceful monument is due to the Romans and was executed after 105 and even as late as the visit of Hadrian in 131 A.D. But Dr. Gustav Dalman who has written so much on the subject, thinks that it is certainly anterior to the Roman conquest. He suggests that it was inspired by Greece in the time of transition dates from 335 B.C., just when Greek influence was strongest in Syria, following on the conquests of Alexander. So, whether the design, which was twice copied in Petra itself, was copied from Greece originally, or was due to the genius of a Nabataean architect, it certainly did not come from Rome. It may well have been a mausoleum, or memorial set in honour of one of the later Nabataean Kings.

Khazne seems to have had originally only four columns supporting the entablature and pediment. Later in order to broaden the effect two more columns were added and the entablature extended. This combination of tomb with a shrine in an upper story is believed to be peculiar to Petra.

This peculiar feature of the upper story having a circular temple or shrine in the middle is imitated in the fine tombs called ""The Corinthian and the huge Deir.""

Ed-Deir – The Convent

It is placed in a magnificent position and is colossal as to size. In the plateau where it stands magnificent views are obtained of the whole Wadi Musa (the Basin) with a distant glimpse of the summit of Mount Hor. The temple itself as a work of art lacks a good proportion and the colour of the stone is cold yellowish. The surroundings are so beautiful that the temple appears all the more disappointing in comparison with the wonderful colour of the other rock tombs.

The strongest appeal is the element of surprise after the very long climb up into what appears to be the most solitary and inaccessible spot, you suddenly catch sight over the natural rock of a huge sculptured urn. How did it get there seems unreal, fantastic. A turn in the stony track brings you on to a flat plateau covered with grass, tulips and wild flowers, and there is a great temple for it looks more like such. You enter with some difficulty, climbing over some stone blocks, and find yourself in a huge hall that has no other outlet. In a niche there is something that may have served as an alter. For sheer weight and the great mass the Deir has its fascination, but as a work of art, it is far below the Khazne. It is that it has an order neither Greek nor Roman, but with something like a Doric frieze over a very plain Corinthian capital above this are three very singular turrets, the use and application of which is difficult to understand.

CHAPTER III

ROMAN PETRA

In 106 A.D. Petra was taken by the Romans and one does know little more of her story. The Nabataeans appear to have fought well to defend their liberties and kept part of the Hauran for some time longer. But the Petraeans became quite Romanised and the city prospered; trade was kept up under Roman direction. They also made one of their famous roads connecting Petra with the Red Sea, and others followed. Improved and Romanised the Nabataean houses erected an Arch at the entrance to the Siq, a triple gate and a Temple and the usual public buildings appeared in the basin of the Wadi Musa, where traces of the streets can still be seen. As usual the religion of the conquered race was respected.

Hadrian paid a visit to Petra (131 A.D.), which was commemorated by a coin bearing the inscription ""Adriane Petra."" The greatest period of prosperity was probably about the end of the first century A.D. But for some centuries to come Petra was a commercial center, which only began to decline in importance when the caravan routes changed, sea being preferred to land and when Palmyra was in the ascendant.

Tomb of Urn

Most of the post-classical tombs belong to the Roman Period. The tomb of Urn is one of the most important, both on account of the simple but majestic style and of the prominent position that it occupies. Standing one hundred feet above the valley temple, for it is undoubtedly a temple and not a tomb, dominates the scene with its four great pilastres supporting an architrave interrupted by small pilastres above which is a triangular pediment on which the urn rests. The temple façade is sculptured from the rock, which is a very beautiful rose or flame red colour, and it stands back on a square platform which rests on an arched substructure of a very massive quality. The labor involved in the engineering was great, and points to the end of the first century A.D. The Temple is approached by a great flight of steps, but these and the substructures are in ruinous condition, and you have to be prepared to climb.

The architecture over the door is ornamented by shields between triglyphs; over it there is a window with three more in the attic; in the center are two figures in bas-relief. To the right and left of the raised terrace are colonnades of pillars of Ionic order, standing out from the wall of rock that forms the side of the enclosure. This feature is quite new to Petra of the Pre-Roman Petra.

Inside we find a large room with wonderful effects of colour in the ceiling and on the walls, which are finally grooved. An inscription tells that the temple was consecrated in 477 A.D. by Bishop Jason.

The tomb with three stories of which the last is not finished. All the rooms are in very damaged condition, having suffered from time and weather more than most. It is a copy of a Roman palace and not that of a temple. It is the only example in Petra. The façade resembles the proscenium of more recent Greek theatres and if it were a tomb, it is one of the most complete misapplications of Greek architecture ever made.

The Corinthian Tomb

This is a Roman copy of the Khazne Fur'Un. The lower story has eight Corinthian; the upper contains the center shrine and two lesser projections; the whole is surmounted by the usual urn.

Sextus Florentinus Tomb

It has latin inscription. The façade shows a central portal flanked by columns.

The Lyon Monument

One of the most striking of the Roman monuments. It is seen on the western side of Petra when climbing up to the Dier looking across the valley. It is not a tomb, but a triclinium. The lions are in low relief on each side of the doorway. The frieze carries two Medusa heads and four paterae. It is obvious that the monument must be a late one. But it is noticeable that it must have been connected with the worship of Dusares.

The Theatre

It is more likely that the theater dates from the time of Aretas III, when there was a great Hellenistic influence in Petra, and the Greeks looked on the theater as a necessity, whereas the Romans preferred the amphitheater as more fit for contests of man and beast to take place. So it is quite likely that it was excavated at the earlier date.

Tunnels were excavated to divert the flood waters that when unpredictably happened could deteriorate paved roads, the monuments and a hazard to the town dwellers. It is not clear if they were excavated by the Nabataeans or Romans. But they are insufficient to solve the occassional flood problems.

It is certain that Christianity penetrated into Petra and the surrounding country. In the fourth century it was a seat of a bishopric.

For long before the Roman débacle began, Petra gradually declined in importance. Her commerce was diverted into other channels, she sinks away into the shadow. Then quite suddenly, at the end, she was destroyed by the Persians and the followers of Mohammed, and vanished altogether from history. The Crusaders partially revived Petra for a very short period of the twelfth century, and built a fort in one of the summits.

JERASH - JORDAN

CHAPTER IV

The ruins of Jerash, the ancient Gerasa of the Decapolis, stand amongst quiet country with the background of soft colored violet coloured hills. Near by Bab-Amman, so called the Triumphal Gate, the corn stands feet high with wild spring flowers sprinkled about the ground. Jerash is located a 45 minute drive from Amman.

The Circassian village on the left bank of the river is too far from the heart of the old town. Jerash is a dead city. It is absorbed in the past because it has remained a fossilized Roman town with not having had additions of later age to disturb the harmony of the past. This is the charm that has made Jerash also so interesting for archeology, as an almost unique example of a Roman town. Although in spirit, the citizens retained much of the original Greek character, there is something of the culture that has outlasted the brief period of Greek power for centuries.

Jerash is situated in a basin surrounded by hills. Through this basin of cultivated land a shallow valley runs a stream – the Chrysorrhoas, the Golden River of the Romans – rushes over the stones, and finally emptying 7000 meters below in the Zerka.

One of the first impressions that you get, as you stand by Bab-Amman is the great extent of the field of ruins. The Great Gate with its triple arch, the mass of columns still standing within what were the city walls, much of which still remains – The Ellipse of the Forum, the upstanding columns of the Great Temple of Artemis and other principal features of the city are all of greatest interest for the archeologist. But there, almost as far as the eye can reach, are little groups of columns standing out on the hillside as lonely evidence of some past habitation. Jerash has a golden stone colouring in contrast to the rosy flame rock of Petra.

The Bab-Amman stands on the Roman road going south to Amman. To the left is a filled-in space where once there was a Naumachia for sham sea-fights and water pageants and beyond it was the Circus. The South Gate set in the wall of the city walls it appears to have been rather like an outer gate, but very little of it remains. Inside the walls, a little to the left of the gate, the ruins of a peripteral temple stand on an artificial terrace on a sudden hillock. The southern wall of the Cella and some columns of the Corinthian order are still to be seen and are called by the Arabs the Beit et-Tei. Near to this temple is the Southern Theater; on the right is the graceful Ellipse of the Forum, columns of Ionic order with the entablature so much in place that you scarcely regret that the oval is not complete.

The great street of columns begins to the north-east of the forum and continues for about half a mile. Two roads intersect this main street which also are colonnaded and which have each a Tetrapylon at the crossing. Between these, nearer to the further street, stood the Great Propylaea of the Temple of Artemis, which stood up on a terrace on rising ground of columns of the Corinthian order that once adorned the Portico are a striking feature of the general view. Near to the temple were various churches, built of the old material. One of these is a fine basilica of the Byzantine period.

The further colonnaded street was the street of the Theater. To the left was the Northern Theater, which seems to have been for gladiatorial shows and other performances dear to the heart of the Roman soldiers. To the right the road ran down to the river where there was once a bridge. On this road were some magnificent Baths. The road which led to the temple was quite a short one; it was continued down to the river passing the site of a later Byzantine church. The first cross road, which is the longest, ran through the Eastern Gates to a steep

flight of steps that led to another bridge over the river. Outside the gates, north and south were sarcophagi; one large mausoleum, that of Es-Samuri has a fine portal and some columns of the Corinthian order. Outside the Northern Gate is the ruin of a basilica that was built with the materials of the pagan sanctuary of Nemesis. This is the skeleton of the town.

There are some remains of an inner line of columns that suggests, that typical of Greco-Roman towns, was surmounted by an open arcade on a level with the first story of the houses. The writer Libanus tells that in Jerash you need never stay indoors because of bad weather as you always had the shelter of the arcades.

From the general layout of the town there was space enough for a Roman legion to have been accommodated. The Crusaders never tried to keep the place as no remains of their fortresses are to be found.

The Triple Gate (Bab-Amman) apparently stood without a connection with the outer wall. It just was a triumphal gate through which people had to pass on their way to Gerasa. The suggested date is that of the arch of Trojan in Rome to which it bears some likeness. It consists of a central arch with lesser openings on either side.

In general the capitals of the columns were mostly Corinthian and the acanthus design of their capitals were of the Roman development of the Greek acanthus, but probably executed by Greek artists, as was very usual in Siria. Whatever was done in this Greco-Roman city was done with the view to the vista and component of modern towns would have offended the Greek sense of the aesthetic order of space and proportions.

Jerash has been said to be second only to Palmyra in size and importance and second only to Baalbeck in beauty of Roman architecture.

Description of the Site

PETRA is a complex of roman ruins consisting of monuments and public buildings carved directly into the pink rock formation of a high and deep Wadi. There are periodic floods that through milleniums have formed this very deep irregular wide wadi. These floods are a hazard to the travelers in some places. Twenty-nine American tourist died because of it two years ago. The floods are also eroding the monuments. As a first step a tunnel for deviation of the waters has recently been built, but this is only part of a protection project. This area is called the Basin. Beduins families, 96 in number are living in the Basin and together with unorganized tourism are causing damage to the monuments. The opening of the wadi into the desert is called the Entrance. This area has many interesting egyptian tomb constructions.

JERASH or JARASH is also a complex of roman ruins located in open land. They consist of large semi circular colonnades, public buildings and monuments. It is located 45 minutes drive from Amman.

Next phase after this project is going to be a large tourism project on the lovely beaches of Aqaba.

Lucho had the information from Tourism Projects Department of The World Bank, that since the second half of 1976 the cost of construction in Jordan has decreased, due to cheap labor coming from Lebanon that has filled the gap created by the Jordanian labor migration to Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, because too much housing development has been going on during the last years, there is a surplus of apartments for rent and very little construction going on.

The Bank estimates the actual cost of construction of a AA 1/2 hotel without movable furniture, movable equipment and miscellaneous supplies is around US $ 658/m²","DISTRIBUTION: Herb Gallagher, Roland Kluver, Dick Brooker, Bob Barnes, Ray Vincent  Lucho had the information from Tourism Projects Department of The...",,Lebanon,World Bank,,construction;from;bank;cost;labor;going;movable,Inglés,Memorándum,1,
